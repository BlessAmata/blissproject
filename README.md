1. fixed the linking on the html page....... images/1.png is better than /images/1.png 

2. changed the hover effect of the button on the top right of the page. hovering over that button usually shifts your menu content.

3. avoid using percentages for your margins and padding... try using rem more not even em!

4. surround your a tag buttons with buttons instead of li tags.

5. when changing hover effects in your buttons, add a transition style to animate the color change.

6. to create a smooth hover button, consider adding a border with line type and color on both the button element as well as the :hover pseudoclass.

7. your dont need to abuse the <br> tag. by default, words wrap around so consider using padding-left or right instead of br tags to break texts.
